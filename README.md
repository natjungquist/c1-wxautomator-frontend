# Webex Automator Frontend

## Project Summary
The Cisco Collaboration team at C1 offers WebEx Calling to customers. This project aims to develop a web application that streamlines the provisioning of WebEx Calling users, workspaces, and devices to WebEx contact centers, making it easier for contact center administrators to provision such WebEx calling items.

The current process for provisioning Webex Calling users, workspaces, and devices for customers this is manual through the desktop app. Utilizing the Webex API, the goal of this project is to build a web application that can provision for Webex contact center customers on behalf of contact center administrators. A program that improves the efficiency of C1’s WebEx projects would greatly benefit C1 as a company and its employees’ lives by reducing the total number of work hours for these tasks and standardizing the process. This is the frontend for this app.

## NOTE
This app is currently in development.
